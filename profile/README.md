Ultraviolet is built as layer 2 on top of Bitcoin; it is further evolution of client-side validation with [RGB smart contracts](https://rgb.tech), ultra-scalable consensus (Prime), data availability network (Storm) and decentralized scalable computing and machine learning network (Prometheus). It is created by [Pandora Prime SA](https://github.com/pandora-prime).
